# Privacy-First Banking Demo

## Overview

This demo showcases a privacy-first peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platform built using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) on Solana via Arcium. It demonstrates how banks can adopt blockchain technology while maintaining customer privacy and regulatory compliance.

## What We're Building

A minimal but functional banking demo that includes:

- **Private P2P Payments**: Users can send money with encrypted transaction amounts
- **Encrypted Transaction Ledger**: All transactions are recorded on-chain but remain private
- **Anonymous Reward System**: Users earn rewards based on activity without revealing transaction details
- **Compliance Verification**: On-chain proofs ensure regulatory requirements are met

## Problem It Solves

### Core Problem
Nepal's banks face a "blockchain adoption deadlock":
- **Regulatory Fears**: Strict crypto bans create uncertainty about blockchain use
- **Privacy Concerns**: Traditional blockchain exposes sensitive financial data
- **Compliance Challenges**: AML/KYC requirements conflict with privacy needs
- **Technical Barriers**: Lack of local expertise and infrastructure

This results in:
- Banks missing global fintech innovations
- Customers lacking modern, private banking options
- Slower digital economy growth in Nepal

### How This Demo Addresses It
- **Privacy-First Transactions**: Sensitive data (amounts, balances) processed encrypted off-chain
- **Regulatory Compliance**: On-chain verification without exposing customer details
- **AML/KYC Compatibility**: Enables compliance checks without data breaches
- **Scalable Proof-of-Concept**: Demonstrates real banking workflows at scale

#
## Target Audience
- **Nepalese Banks**: Proof that blockchain + MPC enables safe adoption
- **Regulators (NRB)**: Shows controlled innovation without systemic risk
- **Customers**: Enables private, modern financial experiences

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Blockchain**: Solana for high-performance on-chain verification
- **MPC Engine**: Arcium for off-chain confidential computations
- **Smart Contracts**: Anchor programs for on-chain logic

### Key Components
- Encrypted payment instructions (Rust/Arcis)
- On-chain payment program (Anchor)
- Test scripts for demonstration
- CLI/Web interface for user interaction

### Privacy Features
- **Encrypted Inputs**: Transaction data encrypted before MPC processing
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verification without revealing sensitive details
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users control when/if to reveal transaction data

## Demo Flow

1. **Setup**: Two users initialize accounts
2. **Payment**: Alice sends encrypted amount to Bob
3. **Processing**: MPC nodes compute transaction off-chain
4. **Verification**: Result verified on-chain without exposing amount
5. **Rewards**: Anonymous reward calculation and distribution
6. **History**: Private transaction ledger maintained

## Benefits Demonstrated
